# Summary

Congratulations on building an audio binary classification speech model!  We have covered the basics of building an audio machine learning model from understanding how analog sound turns to digital sound, to creating spectrogram images of our wave files. We used the Speech Commands dataset, parsed the classes down to `yes` and `no`, then looked at ways we can understand and visualize audio data. From there we took the spectrograms, created images and used a convolutional neural network to build our model. I hope you enjoyed this introduction to audio classification and tried out classifying your own voice!
