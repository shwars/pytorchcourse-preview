# PyTorch Fundamentals Learning Path

This is a preview repository for Microsoft Learn PyTorch Fundamentals learning path. It contains 4 modules:

1. [Introduction to PyTorch](1-intro-to-pytorch)
1. [Introduction to Computer Vision with PyTorch](2-computer-vision-pytorch)
1. [Introduction to Natural Language Processing with PyTorch](3-nlp-pytorch)
1. [Audio Processing with PyTorch](4-audio-pytorch)

This repository contains only Jupyter Notebooks - final Learn Module will feature some additional content, including knowledge checks.

# Running the code

To run the code, you can use one of the following methods:

* Clone the repository and run the code locally. You would need a Python installation with Jupyter support. Install all the dependencies by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run the code in Binder by clicking below:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shwars/pytorchcourse-preview/main)
* Run the code in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). You would need to request early access and wait until it's granted, which may take some time.
* Open code in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/)

> **Note**: Advanced modules on natural language processing are quire computationally intensive and will require GPU to work with comfortably.
