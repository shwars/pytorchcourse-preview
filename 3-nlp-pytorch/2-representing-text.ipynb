    "If we want to solve NLP tasks with Neural Networks, we need some way to represent text as tensors. Computers already represent textual characters as numbers that map to fonts on your screen using coding encodings such as ASCII or UTF-8. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Ascii Code](../images/ASCII.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand what each letter **represents**, and how all characters come together to form the words of a sentence. However, computers by themselves do not have such an understanding, and neural network has to learn the meaning during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use different approaches when representing text:\n",
    "* **Character-level representation**, when we represent text by treating each character as a number. Given that we have $C$ different characters in our text corpus, the word *Hello* would be represented by $5\\times C$ tensor. Each letter would correspond to a tensor column in one-hot encoding.\n",
    "* **Word-level representation**, in which we create a **vocabulary** of all words in our text, and then represent words using one-hot encoding. This approach is somehow better, because each letter by itself does not have much meaning, and thus by using higher-level semantic concepts - words - we simplify the task for the neural network. However, given large dictionary size, we need to deal with high-dimensional sparse tensors."
